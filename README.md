# Update Radio

The Iron Yard Supplemental: Update Radio

Revisit your [radio project](https://github.com/rickmurdock/SoundCloud-Music-Search) and add a postgres database and use sequelize to access the database.

Update your radio so that you can select favorite songs and view them later. Create a 'favorites' page that loads your favorite songs.
